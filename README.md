## Motivation
Customer churn is a major problem and one of the most important concerns for large companies. Due to the direct effect on the revenues of the companies, especially in the telecom field, companies are seeking to develop means to predict potential customer to churn. The main goal of this work is to develop a churn prediction model which assists telecom operators to predict customers who are most likely subject to churn. 
## Data
We will be using customer churn data from the telecom industry. The data file is called 
`Orange_Telecom_Churn_Data.csv`. We will load this data together, do some preprocessing, and use K-nearest neighbors to predict customer churn based on account characteristics.
## Models
* K-nearest neighbors
* Artificial Neural Network
### Results
* K-NN: 91.3% Accuracy
* ANN: 93.8% Accuracy
